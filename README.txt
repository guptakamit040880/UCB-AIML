This readme file contains the information about project work developed by Amit Gupta for AI/ML 2025 program offered by UC Berkley.

Repository has been designed as per modules outlined in the program.

At this point we are building very first assignemnt associated with module 5, so the work is under the folder M5.

Final solution required for module 5 is in the form of jupyter notebook located at M5/assignment5_1_starter/prompt.ipynb

Coming to summay of findings ...
Acceptance of Bar coupon is more likely with the drivers who usually visits the bar more than once a month. Other factors like age over 25, not having kid as passanger, travelling with group add a little more positive on acceptance.
